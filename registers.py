Registers

These are like variables but are implemented as stacks. To store something, you
push in on to a register and to retrieve it you pop it. Registers [a-zA-Z_] are for
users, there are also registers with "private" names: these are used to store
the iterates in for-loops and stuff like that.

Parsing

Pushing to a register is indicated with â€²a where a is the register name. To
remember, imagine the registers are hanging above the line and it is a ramp the
data goes up into the register. Popping is `a where a is the register. You can
remember it along similar lines.

Executing

The push command simply pushes the last stack item to that register, and the pop
command pops the last stack item from that register and places it on the main
stack. That's it.
